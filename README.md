# JToH Tower Tracker Bot

This bot is designed for tracking progress in Juke's Towers of Hell (JToH) directly through Discord, without the need to visit a website. You can check detailed player stats, including:

- Hardest Towers: See the toughest towers a player has completed.
- Jump Progression: Track player jumps and progression metrics.
- Utility Commands: Tools like gradient generation and more

The command concepts come from **CRP Land**, which only functions on their server and restricts use outside of it. This bot was created as an alternative for unrestricted use in your own server.
